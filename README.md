# Web Scraping Project

This project demonstrates web scraping using Python and Selenium.

## About

This project demonstrates web scraping using Python and Selenium. It extracts specific information from a target website and displays it in the console.

Download the appropriate ChromeDriver binary for your operating system from the [ChromeDriver official website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and place it in the project directory.

Note: Make sure to download the version compatible with your Chrome browser.

Update the `chromedriver_path` variable in `scraping.py` with the path to the ChromeDriver binary.

## Usage

1. Run the web scraping script:

python scraping.py

2. The script will scrape the required information from the target website and display it in the console.

3. Customize the scraping logic in `scraping.py` to extract other desired information.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have the correct version of ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser.
- If the script fails to locate elements on the page, inspect the HTML structure and update the code accordingly.
- Comply with the website's terms of service and data usage policies.
